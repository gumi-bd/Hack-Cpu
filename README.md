# Hack-Cpu
A simulation of Hack Cpu on HDL.

- Used nand2tetris to implement combinational logic circuits(Encoder, Decoder, Priority Encoder, Multiplexer, Demultiplexer), different kinds of adders(RCA, CLA, CLA with higher level propagate and generate terms), signed and unsigned multipliers and floating-point multiplier. 
- Finally developed a basic Hack Computer by putting together an ALU, which can perform 18 kinds of operations on the input numbers, and a program counter, as a team of three members
- Must have a Java Runtime Environment to run this simulation
- Put your instructions in .asm and .tst format
